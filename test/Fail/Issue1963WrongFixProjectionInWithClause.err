Issue1963WrongFixProjectionInWithClause.agda:10,1-11,19
With clause pattern R.f is not an instance of its parent pattern
.R.f
since the parent pattern is a postfix projection and the with clause pattern is a prefix projection
when checking that the clause
test .R.f with R
R.f test | _ = Set
has type R
